; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Search
;
;	Deep search (depth first) using parse rule.
;
; Rewrite
;
;	Rewrite text or block (recursively) using search pattern as parse rule and replacement as compose block.
;
;	By default, repeatedly does a top down search and replace until no more occurrences are found.
;
;	Use /once to single top down search and replace pass.
;
;	Use /only to prevent a replacement being immediately reprocessed by continuing the search after the
;	replacement. The replacement will be reprocessed in the next pass.
;
;	By combining /once and /only replacements can be made that would ordinarily cause an infinite loop.
;	E.g:
;
;		rewrite [x] [ ['x][y] ['y]['x]] ; Causes an infinite loop.
;
;		rewrite/once/only [x] [ ['x][y] ['y]['x]] ; One replacement only.
;
;	Place the word trace before each search pattern you want traced. Alternatively
;	use trace on to turn on tracing for all rules until the next trace off.
